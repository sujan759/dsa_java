In Java, operators are classified into several categories based on their functionality. Here are the main types of operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations.

Operator	    Description	Example
+	Addition	    a + b
-	Subtraction	    a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division	    a / b
%	Modulus (Remainder)	a % b

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare values and return a boolean result (true or false).

Operator	         Description	Example
==	Equal to	    a == b
!=	Not equal to	a != b
>	Greater than	a > b
<	Less than	    a < b
>=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
<=	Less than or equal to	a <= b

3. Logical Operators
Used to perform logical operations, mostly in conditional statements.

Operator	        Description	Example
&&	Logical AND 	a > 10 && b < 20
`		`
!	Logical NOT	    !(a > 10)

4. Bitwise Operators
Operate at the bit level.

Operator	        Description	Example
&	Bitwise AND 	a & b
`	`	Bitwise OR
^	Bitwise XOR 	a ^ b
~	Bitwise Complement	~a
<<	Left Shift	    a << 2
>>	Right Shift	    a >> 2
>>>	Unsigned Right Shift	a >>> 2


5. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	            Description	Example
=	Assign value	    a = 5
+=	Add and assign  	a += 5 (same as a = a + 5)
-=	Subtract and assign	a -= 5
*=	Multiply and assign	a *= 5
/=	Divide and assign	a /= 5
%=	Modulus and assign	a %= 5

6. Unary Operators
Operate on a single operand.

Operator	                    Description	Example
+	Unary plus (positive number)	+a
-	Unary minus (negative number)	-a
++	Increment (increase by 1)   	a++ (post-increment), ++a (pre-increment)
--	Decrement (decrease by 1)   	a-- (post-decrement), --a (pre-decrement)

7. Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)
Shorthand for if-else statements.

Operator            	Description	Example
?:	Ternary Operator	result = (a > b) ? a : b;
8. Instanceof Operator
Used to check if an object belongs to a specific class.

Operator	Description	Example
instanceof	Checks instance type	obj instanceof String
9. Type Cast Operator
Used for type conversion.

Operator	                Description	Example
(type)	Type conversion	    int a = (int) 5.6;
10. Lambda Operator (->)
Used in lambda expressions (Java 8 and later).

Operator	Description	Example
->	Lambda expression	(a, b) -> a + b
